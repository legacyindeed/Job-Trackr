# Trackr: The Intelligent Job Application Suite

Trackr is a dual-platform solution designed to automate and simplify your job search journey.

## 🚀 The Ecosystem

### 💻 Trackr Portal (Public)
**URL:** [https://job-trackr-ten.vercel.app](https://job-trackr-ten.vercel.app)
The central command center for your career journey. Open to everyone, the portal allows you to:
- Visualize your job pipeline (Kanban board).
- Manage applications, interviews, and offers.
- Export your data for personal records.
- **Manual Entry**: No extension? No problem. Add applications directly through our web interface.

### 🧩 Trackr Chrome Extension (Private)
*Note: This extension is currently in private development and not available on the Chrome Web Store.*
The extension acts as a background assistant that:
- **Automatic Detection**: Recognizes job postings on LinkedIn, Indeed, and Google.
- **Instant Sync**: One-click tracking that jumps directly into your public portal.
- **Local Cache**: Maintains a recent history of tracked applications.

## 🛠 Installation (Development Only)
